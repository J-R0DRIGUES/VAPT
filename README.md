The primary goal of this assessment was to provide an analysis of security flaws present in Rekall’s
web applications, networks, and systems. This assessment was conducted to identify exploitable
vulnerabilities and provide actionable recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities to
provide a greater level of security for the environment.
We used our proven vulnerability testing methodology to assess all relevant web applications,
networks, and systems in scope.


We used custom, private, and public tools such as Metasploit, hashcat, and Nmap to gain perspective
of the network security from a hacker’s point of view. These methods provide Rekall with an
understanding of the risks that threaten its information, and also the strengths and weaknesses of
the current controls protecting those systems. The results were achieved by mapping the network
architecture, identifying hosts and services, enumerating network and system-level vulnerabilities,
attempting to discover unexpected hosts within the environment, and eliminating false positives that
might have arisen from scanning.


Once exploitation is completed and the assessors have completed their objectives, or have done
everything possible within the allotted time, the assessment team writes the report, which is the final
deliverable to the customer.
